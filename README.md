# Whac-a-Ralph 
Whac-a-Ralph is a fast-paced, browser-based arcade game inspired by the classic Whac-A-Mole, but featuring **Ralph** from **Wreck-It Ralph**. 
Prevent Ralph from wracking the building by smashing him with your mighty hammer.

Originally based on a DIO (Digital Innovation One) project, this version extends the core gameplay with additional features, animations, and UX improvements.

#Feel free to mess around 
- I am planning to...

[] Add visual feedback animation when Ralph is hit

[] Dynamically change gameVelocity as the game progresses

[] Build a mobile version with responsive layout and (maybe) a drawer menu

[] organize engine and CSS into modules for readability
